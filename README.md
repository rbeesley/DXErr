# DxErr
DxErr.lib equivalent, providing support for ANSIand Unicode messages, sourced from nitrocaster, fixed by ChiliTomatoNoodle to resolve bugs and typos, and further modified by me to provide something which works on Windows 10/11 and x86/x64, for use with the inspired ChiliTomatoNoodle C++ 3D DirectX Tutorial project with modern C++20 standards.
